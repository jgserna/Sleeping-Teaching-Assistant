# How to Execute
    This program was created using C++. It will run on Linux using the following commands:

    g++ -g -pthread -o TA TA.cpp
    ./TA [int]   // optional (specify number of threads)
    
# Illustrate each member's contribution. 
    Our team worked together by dividing the tasks. Everyone helped with the coding, and Jay took care of finishing it. We all worked on the design document, and Rith made a visual chart showing how the program works. Leonel and Noemi focused on writing the README file.
